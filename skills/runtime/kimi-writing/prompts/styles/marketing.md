# Marketing / Copywriting Style Guide

## Domain Context

Marketing writing exists to persuade and convert. Every word earns its keep. The reader's attention is borrowed—don't waste it.

## Tone

- **Persuasive:** Every element serves conversion
- **Benefit-focused:** What's in it for them?
- **Urgent:** Act now, not later

## Voice

- Conversational and accessible
- Confident without hype
- Understands customer pain points
- Speaks to specific objections

## Key Terminology

- **Funnel:** awareness, consideration, decision, retention
- **Metrics:** CTR, conversion rate, CAC, LTV, ROAS
- **Elements:** headline, subheadline, CTA, social proof, objection handling

## What Works

- **Specific benefits:** "Save 3 hours/day" not "boost productivity"
- **Social proof:** "2,000 farms use this" not "trusted by farmers"
- **Numbers that matter:** 40% cost reduction, not "significant savings"
- **Urgency with reason:** not "limited time!" but "offer ends Friday"
- **Clear CTA:** exactly what to do, no ambiguity

## What to Avoid

- Generic claims ("best," "world-class," "revolutionary")
- Vague promises without specifics
- Hype without substance
- Features without benefits
- Buried CTA
- Corporate speak

## Copy Formulas

### AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

1. **Attention:** Hook immediately
2. **Interest:** Build with specifics
3. **Desire:** Show what life looks like after
4. **Action:** Clear next step

### PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve)

1. **Problem:** State the pain point
2. **Agitate:** Make it worse (real stakes)
3. **Solve:** Present the solution

### BAB (Before, After, Bridge)

1. **Before:** Current state (painful)
2. **After:** Desired state (better)
3. **Bridge:** How to get there

## Common Writing Scenarios

### Landing Page Headline

Must answer: what is it, what's the benefit, who is it for?

Formula: [Benefit] for [Audience] in [Timeframe]

Examples:

- "Reduce water costs by 40% in 90 days for corn growers"
- "Launch your SaaS in weeks, not months"
- "Stop losing customers to churn"

### Email Subject Line

Max 50 characters. Test variations:

- Benefit-focused: "Cut churn in half"
- Curiosity: "The mistake 80% of farms make"
- Urgency: "Offer ends Friday"
- Question: "Leaving money on the table?"

### Product Description

Structure: Hook, Problem, Solution, Evidence, CTA

"Late-season frost cost you 15% of your corn yield last year. Our cold-tolerant variety extends your harvest window by 14 days. Tested across 200 Midwest farms. Protected yields. Schedule your consultation."

### Social Media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)

Hook + specific benefit + CTA. 1-2 key hashtags.

"Texas farms lost $2B to drought in 2023. Our precision irrigation system saved $150K per 500 acres. Case study: [link] #agtech #farming"

### Ad Copy (Facebook, Google)

Problem + solution + CTA. Social proof helps.

"Wasted water costs. Our sensors cut irrigation by 30% while boosting yield 8%. 200+ farms in the Midwest. Book a demo."

## Persuasion Techniques

### Specificity

Numbers build trust. Specific beats general every time:

- "reduces costs by 27%" > "lowers costs"
- "3 hours saved daily" > "saves time"
- "200 farms in Iowa" > "trusted by farmers"

### Social Proof

- Numbers: "2,000+ users"
- Names: logos of recognizable brands
- Testimonials: specific, with details
- Ratings: 4.8/5 from 500 reviews

### Scarcity + Urgency

- Limited quantity: "50 spots available"
- Time-limited: "Offer ends Friday"
- Exclusive: "Only for existing customers"

### Risk Reversal

- Free trial
- Money-back guarantee
- No-risk consultation
- "Try for 14 days, cancel anytime"

## Objection Handling

Common objections → specific responses:

- "Too expensive" → Show ROI, break-even calculation
- "Won't work for me" → Case studies from similar customers
- "Don't have time" → Implementation time, onboarding
- "Not sure it's real" → Social proof, testimonials

## Voice by Channel

### Email

More personal, conversational. Can be longer.

### Social Media

Punchy, visual-friendly. Hashtags matter.

### Website

More formal, thorough. Conversion-focused.

### Ads

Brevity, hook, CTA. Every character counts.

## Testing and Optimization

- A/B test headlines
- Test CTA language
- Test length (short vs long)
- Test tone (direct vs conversational)

## Numbers to Include

- % improvement
- Time saved
- Money saved/earned
- Customer count
- Rating/review count
- Days to implement

## Words That Convert

- "You" (over "we")
- "Free"
- "Now"
- "Save"
- "Guarantee"
- "Proven"
- "Only" (scarcity)

## Words That Kill Conversion

- "Learn more" (vague)
- "Submit" (clinical)
- "Sign up" (generic, unless there's a benefit)
- Generic superlatives
- Jargon

## Final Checklist

- Is the benefit clear and specific?
- Is the CTA unambiguous?
- Is there social proof?
- Are objections addressed?
- Is there urgency with a reason?
- Does every sentence earn its place?
