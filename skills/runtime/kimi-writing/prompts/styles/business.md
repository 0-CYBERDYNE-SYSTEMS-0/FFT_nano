# Business Writing Style Guide

## Domain Context

Business writing exists to get work done. Clarity, specificity, and respect for the reader's time are non-negotiable.

## Tone

- **Professional:** Not stiff, not casual—appropriate to the situation
- **Direct:** Get to the point quickly
- **Results-oriented:** Focus on outcomes, not process for its own sake

## Voice

- Competent and reliable
- Strategic but actionable
- Respectful of hierarchy and decision-making
- Confident without being arrogant

## Key Terminology

- **Financials:** ROI, ARR, MRR, EBITDA, margin, burn rate, runway
- **Operations:** KPIs, OKRs, SLAs, QBRs, roadmap, milestones
- **Strategy:** market fit, competitive advantage, differentiation, positioning
- **People:** retention, onboarding, performance, culture, alignment

## What Works

- Specific outcomes: "reduced churn by 12%" not "improved retention"
- Clear next steps: what happens next, who does what
- Appropriate metrics: the ones that matter to the business
- Executive summary first: bottom line up front (BLUF)
- Context before detail: why this matters, then the details

## What to Avoid

- Fluff and filler words
- Corporate jargon without meaning ("synergy," "paradigm shift")
- Overlong sentences (more than 25 words is pushing it)
- Passive voice when active is possible
- Buried lead (main point not in first paragraph)

## Common Writing Scenarios

### Executive Summary

Max 200 words. Structure:

1. Recommendation or headline finding
2. Supporting numbers
3. Action required (if any)

Example:
"We recommend acquiring [Company] for $12M. Strategic fit is strong: combined ARR of $8M, 40% market overlap, technology that fills a key gap. DD timeline 4 weeks. Close targeted Q2."

### Proposal

Structure: Problem, Solution, Evidence, Cost, Timeline, Next Steps

- Problem: Clear, quantified, urgent
- Solution: Specific, differentiated, actionable
- Evidence: Data, case studies, references
- Cost: Total, breakdown, payment terms
- Timeline: Milestones, dependencies, realistic

### Email

Subject line matters—make it specific.
Body: One topic per email. Clear ask. Deadline if needed.

Example:
Subject: Approval needed: $50K for marketing Q2 campaign

Budget and timeline attached. Key points:

- Targeting new segment (agtech, $5-10M ARR)
- Expected pipeline: $400K
- Launch date: March 15

Approval needed by Friday to secure media buys.

### Report

Executive summary → Detailed findings → Recommendations → Appendix

- Use headings liberally
- Data tables > paragraphs of numbers
- Recommendations numbered, prioritized
- Clear methodology

## Metrics to Use

- **Growth:** YoY, QoQ, MoM growth rates
- **Financial:** Margin, CAC, LTV, payback period
- **Operations:** Efficiency, throughput, defect rates
- **People:** Engagement, retention, productivity

## Formatting Rules

- Use bullet lists for 3+ items
- Numbered lists for sequences
- Bold for key numbers/highlights
- Headings every 2-3 paragraphs
- One idea per paragraph

## Voice by Stakeholder

- **CEO:** Strategic, high-level, outcomes-focused
- **CFO:** Numbers-driven, risk-aware, precise
- **COO:** Operational, process-focused, realistic
- **Engineering:** Technical but clear, tradeoffs explicit
- **Sales:** Customer-focused, competitive, urgency

## Common Pitfalls

- Vague commitments ("we'll try our best") → specific commitments ("Q2 delivery")
- Over-promising ("world-class," "best-in-class") → specific claims
- Buried recommendations → front and center
- Missing next steps → clear action items
- Passive voice ("mistakes were made") → active voice ("we missed deadline")
