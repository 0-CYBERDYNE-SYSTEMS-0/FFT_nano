# Creative Writing Style Guide

## Domain Context
Creative writing exists to engage, move, and stay with the reader. Technical perfection matters less than emotional resonance and authentic voice.

## Tone
- **Authentic:** Voice-driven, consistent, distinctive
- **Emotionally true:** Earned, not forced
- **Respectful of the genre:** Conventions exist for a reason

## Voice
- Distinctive and memorable
- Not trying too hard
- Aware of rhythm and cadence
- Consistent throughout

## What Works
- **Show, don't tell:** "He slammed the door" not "He was angry"
- **Sensory details:** Smells, sounds, textures, not just visuals
- **Specific over general:** "1987 Honda Civic" not "old car"
- **Active verbs:** "She raced" not "She ran quickly"
- **Unexpected details:** The thing that surprises you

## What to Avoid
- Clichés and overused phrases
- Purple prose (over-ornate language)
- Emoting instead of showing
- Predictable structures
- Telling the reader how to feel

## Story Structure Basics
- **Setup:** Establish stakes, introduce characters/world
- **Inciting incident:** Disrupts status quo
- **Rising action:** Complications, choices, consequences
- **Climax:** Point of no return
- **Falling action:** Aftermath
- **Resolution:** New normal

## Character Writing
- **Want vs. Need:** What they want vs. what they actually need
- **Flaws:** Perfect characters are boring
- **Voice:** How do they speak? What do they not say?
- **Actions over descriptions:** Show who they are through what they do

## Dialogue Tips
- Subtext: What's not said matters more than what is
- Different characters sound different
- Interrupts, pauses, unfinished sentences
- No "As you know, Bob" exposition dumps
- Tag variety (said, whispered, muttered—not creative synonyms)

## Setting the Scene
- Specific over generic: "smell of diesel and wet dirt" not "industrial smell"
- Time of day and season matter
- Weather reflects or contrasts mood
- Small details ground big emotions

## Pacing
- Short sentences/frequent breaks for tension
- Longer, flowing sentences for reflection
- Mix it up—rhythm matters
- Action scenes: short, punchy
- Emotional scenes: slower, more interior

## Common Writing Scenarios

### Narrative Opening
Start in the middle of action or with a specific, evocative image:
"The first frost came three weeks early. By dawn, everything was dead—tomatoes, the last of the beans, the hope we'd been harboring since August."

### Character Introduction
Show, don't tell, through action or context:
"Maria cleaned her glasses three times in ten minutes. First the left lens, then the right, then both again. The meeting hadn't started and already her hands betrayed her."

### Ending
Resolve the emotional journey, leave the reader with something:
"The train pulled away. He watched until the taillights faded into the darkness, and then he turned and walked toward the only life he'd ever known."

## Genre Considerations

### Literary Fiction
- Interiority: what characters think, not just do
- Ambiguity: not everything is explained
- Language as craft: rhythm, metaphor, precision

### Genre Fiction (mystery, sci-fi, fantasy)
- Respect genre conventions
- Deliver on reader expectations
- Plot + character equally important
- World-building through detail, not exposition

### Creative Nonfiction
- Truthfulness matters
- Scene vs. reflection balance
- Reader needs to care about the subject
- Personal stakes: why does this matter to you?

## Revision Checklist
- Does each scene advance story or reveal character?
- Are there unnecessary adjectives/adverbs?
- Is voice consistent?
- Would a real person talk like this?
- Are there clichés to replace?
- Does the opening hook immediately?
- Does the ending land emotionally?

## Reading to Write
Read the kind of writing you want to do. Pay attention to:
- How do they structure scenes?
- What do they leave unsaid?
- How do they handle dialogue?
- When do they use short sentences vs. long?

## Final Thought
Good creative writing feels discovered, not assembled. The best lines feel inevitable once you read them, even if you couldn't have predicted them.
