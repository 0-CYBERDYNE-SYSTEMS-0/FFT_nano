# Agriculture Writing Style Guide

## Domain Context
Farming is real work with real stakes. Your writing reflects that reality—seasonal cycles, weather uncertainty, financial pressure, and generations of knowledge.

## Tone
- **Practical:** Solutions must work in the field, not on paper
- **Grounded:** Respect the dirt, the sweat, the reality
- **Direct:** Farmers don't have time for fluff

## Voice
- Experienced without being arrogant
- Knowledgeable about specific crops, equipment, challenges
- Understands seasonality, weather, regional differences
- Respects generational wisdom and innovation both

## Key Terminology
- **Crops:** soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton, alfalfa, vegetables
- **Operations:** planting, harvest, irrigation, pest management, soil health
- **Equipment:** combines, tractors, planters, sprayers, drones
- **Metrics:** yield per acre, bushels, gallons per acre, ROI, break-even
- **Conditions:** soil moisture, temperature zones, rainfall, frost dates

## What Works
- Real examples: "Last year's drought in Texas taught us..."
- Specific numbers: "reduces water use by 30%" not "significant savings"
- Seasonal context: "planting windows open in March for our region"
- ROI calculations: actual numbers farmers care about
- Practical challenges: equipment downtime, labor shortages, weather volatility

## What to Avoid
- Urban metaphors ("synergy," "paradigm shift")
- Overly academic language
- Dismissive of traditional methods
- Generic "save time" claims without specifics
- Ignoring regional differences

## Common Writing Scenarios

### Product Description
Start with the problem, then the solution, then the numbers:
"Late-season soybeans took a hit from unexpected frost in November. Our cold-tolerant variety extends your harvest window by 14 days, protecting 15-20% more yield. Tested across 200 farms in the Midwest."

### Educational Content
Progressive complexity, real examples:
"Precision irrigation isn't just about saving water—it's about putting water where the crop needs it. Here's how a 120-acre soy operation reduced water costs by 40% while improving yield 8%..."

### Technical Documentation
Assume competence, don't over-explain:
"The sensor array measures soil moisture at three depths: 6", 18", and 36". Calibrate before first use. Replace annually."

## Regional Considerations
- **Midwest:** Corn/soybeans, large acreage, equipment-focused
- **South:** Cotton, peanuts, longer seasons, heat stress
- **West:** Specialty crops, water scarcity, labor-intensive
- **Northeast:** Dairy, vegetables, smaller operations, direct-to-consumer

## Seasonal Frame
Writing should acknowledge that farming is cyclical:
- January-March: Planning, equipment maintenance
- April-June: Planting, early-season issues
- July-September: Peak operations, mid-season stress
- October-December: Harvest, financial planning

## Trust Signals
- Mention specific farm sizes and types
- Reference USDA data or university extensions
- Acknowledge when something is experimental
- Respect skepticism about new tech
