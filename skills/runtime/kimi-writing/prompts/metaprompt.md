# Kimi-K2.5 Writing Metaprompt

## Purpose
This metaprompt guides the writing process for optimal results across domains and use cases.

## Before You Write

### Step 1: Contextualize
Answer these questions internally:
1. **Who is the reader?** (audience, expertise, pain points)
2. **What do they need?** (information, action, emotion)
3. **Why does it matter now?** (urgency, relevance, stakes)
4. **What format serves best?** (article, email, doc, copy)

### Step 2: Structure First
For any writing over 500 words:

**Opening Hook** (1-2 sentences)
- Make them care immediately
- Promise specific value
- Use tension or curiosity

**Core Structure**
- 3-5 major points maximum
- Each point = 1-2 paragraphs
- Use headings for navigation
- End each section with transition

**Closing**
- Restate main value
- Clear next action (if applicable)
- Leave lasting impression

### Step 3: Voice Calibration
Match voice to purpose:

| Purpose | Voice | Example Opener |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Inform | Clear, confident, precise | "Three factors determine irrigation efficiency..." |
| Persuade | Direct, benefit-focused, urgent | "You're losing $15K annually to water waste." |
| Entertain | Engaging, specific, voice-driven | "The tractor wouldn't start on the coldest day of the year." |
| Educate | Scaffolded, example-rich, patient | "Let's break this down into three steps..." |

## During Writing

### Sentence Rhythm
Mix sentence lengths naturally:
- **Short (5-10 words):** Punch, emphasis, pace
- **Medium (15-20 words):** Most sentences
- **Long (25+ words):** Complex ideas, lists, qualifications

Ratio: 50% short, 40% medium, 10% long

### Paragraph Architecture
- **Topic sentence:** Main point
- **Evidence:** Examples, data, specifics
- **Elaboration:** Connect to reader's world
- **Transition:** Bridge to next idea

### Specificity Anchors
Every claim needs:
- **A number:** "27%" not "significant"
- **A timeframe:** "90 days" not "soon"
- **An example:** "Like the Henderson farm" not "many farms"
- **A contrast:** "Before vs after"

### The "So What?" Test
After each paragraph, ask:
- Does this change what the reader thinks?
- Does this give them something to do?
- Does this help them understand better?

If no, cut or strengthen.

## After Writing

### Anti-Slop Audit
Check for:
- [ ] Generic openers ("In today's fast-paced world")
- [ ] Buzzwords without meaning ("leverage," "synergy")
- [ ] Corporate speak ("delve into," "unlock potential")
- [ ] Empty enthusiasm ("exciting," "game-changing")
- [ ] Vague claims without numbers
- [ ] Paragraphs that all start the same way
- [ ] Adverbs ending in "-ly" (overuse)

### Voice Consistency
- [ ] Same person throughout ("you" vs "the user")
- [ ] Same tense (past, present)
- [ ] Same formality level
- [ ] No sudden style shifts

### The Reading Aloud Test
Read it aloud. Does it:
- Flow naturally?
- Sound like a person talking?
- Have rhythm and variation?
- Feel honest?

### The Skim Test
Can someone skim and get the main points?
- Clear headings?
- Bold key numbers?
- Bullets for lists?
- Short paragraphs?
